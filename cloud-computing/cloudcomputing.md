# Use Case 1: Remote Work Solution
## Background:
Contoso has 50 employees working remotely. They need a way to provide secure access to corporate applications without requiring employees to have high-end hardware.
## Use Case Objective:
Design and implement a solution that provides secure and cost-effective access to virtual desktops for employees working from different locations. The solution must be scalable.
## Design and Architecture:
- Virtual Desktop Environment: Set up an environment where employees can access their applications securely from any device. Ensure that the virtual desktop is scalable based on user demand.
- Cost Control: Use virtual desktop configurations that maximize resource efficiency without compromising performance.
- Security: Implement identity management to ensure that only authorized employees can access the environment. Ensure that data in the virtual desktops is protected.
- Scalability: Ensure that the solution can scale up or down based on usage.
## Implementation:
- Set up a virtual desktop environment that allows employees to connect remotely.
- Configure the environment to scale based on active users.
- Implement secure access controls to protect the desktops and sensitive data.
- Ensure the solution fits within the $50 monthly budget, optimizing the use of resources.
# Use Case 2: Cloud Security and Protection
## Background:
Contoso needs to protect its cloud-based resources and ensure that data is secure and compliant with industry standards. They have 50 employees and store sensitive data in the cloud. The solution must ensure monitoring, compliance, and threat detection.
## Use Case Objective:
Provide a security solution that monitors and protects the company’s cloud-based resources, detects potential threats, and ensures compliance with industry standards. The solution must be cost-effective.
## Design and Architecture:
- Security Monitoring: Design a security solution that monitors resources for potential vulnerabilities and provides real-time alerts about threats.
- Data Protection: Implement measures that ensure the sensitive data is protected and encrypted both at rest and in transit.
- Compliance: Design a solution that can help Contoso meet any regulatory or compliance requirements.
- Cost Efficiency: Use tools that help reduce unnecessary expenses while still ensuring strong security and monitoring.
## Implementation:
- Set up monitoring to continuously check for threats to cloud resources.
- Implement security protocols to protect sensitive data.
- Use a solution that helps to ensure the company meets compliance requirements.
# Use Case 3: Hybrid Cloud Resource Management 
## Background:
Contoso, with 50 employees, needs to extend its hybrid cloud capabilities. The company wants to manage resources across both their Azure environment and on-premises (which is represented by Azure VMs in this case). They want a solution to manage their Azure VMs from a single location, with governance, security, and monitoring integrated into their workflow. 
## Use Case Objective:
Provide a solution that enables Contoso to manage their Azure VMs as if they were on-premises servers using Azure Arc, even though Azure VMs are not traditionally managed by Azure Arc.
## Design and Architecture:
- Hybrid Management: The solution should allow Contoso to manage their Azure VMs using Azure Arc by recognizing them as on-prem servers.
- Security and Monitoring: Set up monitoring to track the health, security, and compliance of these VMs.
- Cost Efficiency: The architecture should take advantage of cost-efficient VM configurations while staying within the budget.
- Resource Governance: Implement governance controls to ensure compliance with corporate policies.
## Implementation:
- Step 1: Create an Azure VM. This will represent Contoso’s on-prem resource.
- Step 2: Use PowerShell commands to connect this Azure VM to Azure Arc, making it appear as an on-prem server.
- Step 3: Configure monitoring and governance to track the health and compliance of the Azure VM.

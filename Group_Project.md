# Safari's Exciting Tech Challenge!

## About Safari: 
Safari is a university dedicated to providing tailored learning experiences that cater to the unique needs of each student. Unlike conventional educational institutions, Safari University delivers learning through innovative methods that extend beyond traditional approaches. Among the many services offered, final year and postgraduate students benefit from comprehensive CV reviews and career advice, ensuring they are well-prepared to enter the workforce.

## Challenge Overview: 
At Safari, we believe in pushing boundaries and exploring new horizons. Our current CV collection process needs a makeover, and we need your creativity and technical prowess to make it happen! Your mission, should you choose to accept it, is to develop a cutting-edge solution using solutions like Microsoft Power Platform, Azure services, Entra ID & Microsoft Purview.

## Objective: 
Join us on an adventure to revolutionize how we collect and manage candidate CVs, ensuring top-notch security and confidentiality every step of the way.

## Tasks:
### Power Platform Canvas App Development:
- Create a Canvas App: Design an intuitive and engaging app that makes CV submission a breeze for candidates.
- User-Friendly Interface: Ensure the app is as easy to navigate as a safari through the savannah.

### Azure Storage Integration:
- Secure Storage: Store the submitted CVs in an Azure Blob Storage container, keeping them safe and sound.
- Access Controls: Implement robust access controls to ensure only authorized Safari rangers can access the CVs.

### Security Implementation:
- MFA Integration: Enforce Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to access the Canvas App, adding an extra layer of security.
- Seamless Experience: Make sure MFA is as smooth as a lion's stride, without disrupting the user experience.

### Data Protection:
- Sensitivity Labels: Create and apply sensitivity labels to classify and protect confidential information.
- Automatic Protection: Implement policies to automatically encrypt and restrict access to sensitive data based on these labels.

## Expected Outcomes:
- A sleek and functional Power Platform Canvas App for CV submission.
- Secure storage of CVs in Azure Blob Storage with top-tier access controls.
- Enhanced security with MFA.
- Automatic protection of confidential data through sensitivity labels and encryption.

## Evaluation Criteria:
- App Functionality: How well does the Canvas App perform?
- Security Measures: Are the MFA and access controls effective?
- Data Protection: Are sensitivity labels and data protection policies properly implemented?
- User Experience: Is the overall system smooth and enjoyable to use?

## Project Requirements:
- Timeline: Each group has 2 weeks to complete task.

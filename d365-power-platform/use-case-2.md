Identify Key Tables ‚Äì Below are the necessary tables you must create:

Customers (CustomerID, Name, Email, Phone, Address)

Orders (OrderID, CustomerID, OrderDate, Status, TotalAmount)

Products (ProductID, Name, Description, Price, StockQuantity)

OrderDetails (OrderDetailID, OrderID, ProductID, Quantity, Subtotal)

Inventory (InventoryID, ProductID, WarehouseLocation, StockLevel)

Employees (EmployeeID, Name, Role, Department, Email)

Payments (PaymentID, OrderID, PaymentMethod, Amount, PaymentDate)

Products are stored in Inventory.

Each Order has a corresponding Payment.

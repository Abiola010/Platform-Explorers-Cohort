# Welcome to the Product Management Track!

As we begin this journey together, here are a few guidelines and expectations to help us stay aligned and get the best out of this program.

1. Participate actively by engaging in discussions, asking questions, and contributing. <br><br>
2. Be open to feedback. <br><br>
3. ⁠Meet deadlines for your deliverables as this mirrors real world product management. <br><br>
4. Collaboration is key. <br><br>
5. Need help? Do not hesitate to speak up. Product managers don’t work in isolation. <br><br>
6. Feel free to share interesting product-related resources within the group. <br><br>
7. Mistakes are part of the process, embrace them. Fail fast, learn fast. <br><br>

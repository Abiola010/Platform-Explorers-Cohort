# AI-Powered Career Mentorship Platform
## Scenario:
A company, Pathway AI, wants to build an AI-driven career mentorship platform that matches users with mentors based on their industry, career goals, and personality.
## Current challenge:
There are many mentorship platforms, but most:
Struggle with mentor availability (mentors get overwhelmed)
Have poor matching algorithms (wrong mentor-mentee pairings)
Don’t track mentee progress effectively
## Your task:
Define the MVP scope – what should the first version include?
Propose an effective matching system that ensures relevant mentor-mentee connections
Suggest ways to keep mentors engaged without overwhelming them
How would you measure success after launching?
If you had only $50,000 for development, how would you allocate the budget?

Technical Use Case: Device Management and Zero Trust Strategy 

Overview 

Contoso, an organization with 500 users located in South Africa and East Europe, has recently purchased Microsoft 365 E5 licenses. They aim to manage their Windows and iOS company-assigned devices, protect these devices using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint, and implement a Zero Trust strategy with Multi-Factor Authentication (MFA) to ensure only compliant endpoints can access Microsoft 365 applications. 

Device Configuration and Compliance Policies 

To manage user devices effectively, Contoso wishes to implement the following device configuration and compliance policies using Microsoft Intune: 

Device Compliance Policies: 

Windows Devices: 

Require BitLocker encryption. 

Ensure Secure Boot is enabled. 

Require code integrity. 

Specify minimum and maximum OS versions 

Minimum: Windows 10 22H2 (Build 19045.5608) 

Maximum: Windows 11 24H2 (Build 26100.3476) 

iOS Devices: 

Enforce device passcode. 

Require encryption. 

Specify minimum and maximum OS versions. 

Minimum: iOS 16.1.1 

Maximum: iOS 18.1.1 

Device Configuration Policies: 

Windows Devices: 

Configure Windows Update settings. 

Set up Windows Defender Antivirus. 

iOS Devices: 

Configure email profiles. 

Microsoft Defender for Endpoint Implementations 

To protect Windows and iOS devices, Contoso can configure the following implementations using Microsoft Defender for Endpoint: 

Windows Devices: 

Enable real-time protection. 

Configure network protection. 

Set up attack surface reduction rules. 

Enable endpoint detection and response (EDR). 

Configure automated investigation and response (AIR) capabilities. 

iOS Devices: 

Enable web protection to guard against phishing and unsafe network connections. 

Configure network protection. 

Set up jailbreak detection. 

Integrate with Intune for device compliance and conditional access policies. 

Sample Policies and Screenshots 

To provide a comprehensive guide, include sample policies and screenshots of the configuration steps. This will help Contoso's IT team understand the implementation process and ensure a smooth rollout. 

Report of Research and Findings 

Prepare a detailed report summarizing the research and findings, including the benefits of the proposed policies, potential challenges, and recommendations for successful implementation. This report should serve as a reference for Contoso's IT team and stakeholders.

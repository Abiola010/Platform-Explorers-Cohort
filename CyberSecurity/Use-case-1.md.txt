Mitigating Fraudulent Emails at Contoso 
Company Overview: 
Contoso is a mid-sized organization with 300 users located in the United States and Western Europe. The company has been experiencing a significant challenge with fraudulent emails being delivered to end users' mailboxes, posing a risk of phishing attacks and potential data breaches. 
Problem Statement:  
Contoso's email system is currently vulnerable to fraudulent emails, which are being delivered to end users' mailboxes. This issue has raised concerns about the security of sensitive information and the potential for phishing attacks. The company needs to implement a robust solution to mitigate this risk and protect its users, especially VIP users such as the CEO, CFO, and CISO. 
Objective:  
To seek advice from a security analyst on the resolution of the fraudulent email issue, including the type of Microsoft 365 plan that can be purchased, features that can help mitigate the concern, and configuration steps that can be taken to protect the organization. The analyst needs to configure their recommended policies to solve the business problem. Additionally, the analyst should take screenshots of the configuration steps and upload them to their GitHub repository, explaining their thought process and any potential implications of the new policies. The analyst should also determine if these steps should be applied to a group of test users first before being rolled out to the entire organization, ensuring the protection of VIP users. 
Also, the analyst should advise on how to get stakeholder reports of mail flow to and from the organization.
